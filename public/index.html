        <span id="chevron" class="chevron down"></span>
      </h2>
      <div id="description-content" style="display: block;">
        <p>üéâ Welcome to my upgraded Olympic Points System! I believe every medal should be celebrated and valued
          fairly. My system awards points as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>25 points for gold ü•á</li>
          <li>10 points for silver ü•à</li>
          <li>4 points for bronze ü•â</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This 2.5x multiplication pattern ensures a balanced and accurate reflection of athletic achievements.</p>

        <h3>Why This System Works</h3>
        <div class="why-system-works">
          <h4 onclick="toggleSection('section1')">üîç Clear and Balanced Differentiation
            <span id="chevron-section1" class="chevron right"></span>
          </h4>
          <p id="section1" class="collapsible-content">The 2.5x factor establishes a significant yet fair distinction
            between medal types. Gold medals are given the highest value, reflecting their prestige, while silver and
            bronze medals are also rightfully rewarded. This mirrors the competitive spirit of the Olympics, where every
            medal counts.</p>

          <h4 onclick="toggleSection('section2')">üèÖ Encourages Pursuit of Excellence
            <span id="chevron-section2" class="chevron right"></span>
          </h4>
          <p id="section2" class="collapsible-content">Our system motivates athletes to aim for the top! Gold medals
            hold the most value, but winning any medal is highly rewarding. This drives athletes to push their limits
            and perform their best across all events, promoting a culture of excellence and perseverance.</p>

          <h4 onclick="toggleSection('section3')">‚öñÔ∏è Maintains Competitive Balance
            <span id="chevron-section3" class="chevron right"></span>
          </h4>
          <p id="section3" class="collapsible-content">By avoiding extreme point disparities, my system ensures that no
            single medal type is disproportionately favored. This balanced approach maintains fair competition, where
            silver and bronze medals contribute proportionally to the overall score, ensuring a fair and comprehensive
            ranking.</p>

          <h4 onclick="toggleSection('section4')">üåç Fair Representation of Athletic Prowess
            <span id="chevron-section4" class="chevron right"></span>
          </h4>
          <p id="section4" class="collapsible-content">Countries with a diverse collection of gold, silver, and bronze
            medals are accurately represented in the rankings. This method showcases the overall athletic strength of
            nations excelling in various events, providing a more comprehensive picture of their prowess.</p>

          <h4 onclick="toggleSection('section5')">üëÄ Enhances Viewer Understanding and Engagement
            <span id="chevron-section5" class="chevron right"></span>
          </h4>
          <p id="section5" class="collapsible-content">The straightforward 2.5x pattern is easy for viewers to
            understand, making the competition more transparent and enjoyable. Fans can easily grasp the rationale
            behind the rankings, enhancing their engagement and making the games more exciting to follow.</p>
